This app looks through all jewel seeds to find setted up stats or finds all stats for entered jewel.

WARNING: it needs file skillGroups.txt, where all skills which it checks would be presented.

skillGroups.txt syntax:
```
_Skill group name
SkillOne
SkillTwo
SkillThree
...
SkillLast

_Another skill group name
SkillOne
SkillTwo
SkillThree
...
SkillLast
```

All seeds calculation results are in results.json(if u want next manipulations) or in results_readable.txt if you are default user.
Exact seed result will be printed on screen(to few information to be packed)

Enjoy!
